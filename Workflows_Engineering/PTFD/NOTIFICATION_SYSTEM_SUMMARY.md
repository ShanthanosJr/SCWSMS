# Project Notification System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The notification system has been successfully implemented to send automatic email and SMS notifications to project owners when a new project is created in the system.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Notification Functions
Located in: `/Users/kavishka_r/Documents/ITP/SCWMS/PTFD/Backend/Controllers/ProjectControllers.js`

- **Email Notifications**: Using Nodemailer with HTML template
- **SMS Notifications**: Using Twilio API
- **Configuration Validation**: Checks for proper environment variable setup
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking notification errors (project creation still succeeds)

### 2. Environment Configuration
Located in: `/Users/kavishka_r/Documents/ITP/SCWMS/PTFD/Backend/.env`

- Email configuration (Gmail example with App Password)
- Twilio SMS configuration
- Clear instructions for setting up credentials

### 3. Integration with Project Creation
- Notifications automatically sent after successful project creation
- Both email and SMS are sent if contact information is provided
- System gracefully handles missing or invalid configurations

## How It Works

1. **Project Creation**: When a user submits a new project through the frontend form
2. **Validation**: System validates all required fields including contact information
3. **Database Storage**: Project is saved to MongoDB
4. **Notification Trigger**: After successful database save, notification functions are called
5. **Email Sending**: HTML formatted email sent to project owner's email address
6. **SMS Sending**: SMS message sent to project owner's phone number
7. **Error Handling**: If notifications fail, project creation still succeeds

## Testing Performed

1. **Backend Server**: Verified server starts without errors
2. **Environment Variables**: Confirmed proper loading of configuration
3. **Project Creation**: Successfully created test project through API
4. **Notification Trigger**: Verified notification functions are called
5. **Error Handling**: Tested graceful handling of invalid credentials

## Setup Instructions

### For Email Notifications:
1. Update `EMAIL_USER` with your email address
2. Generate an App Password for Gmail or use appropriate credentials for other providers
3. Update `EMAIL_PASS` with your App Password
4. Optionally update `EMAIL_FROM` with your preferred sender name

### For SMS Notifications:
1. Sign up for a Twilio account at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. Get your Account SID (must start with "AC") and Auth Token from the Twilio Console
3. Update `TWILIO_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH` with your credentials
4. Purchase a Twilio phone number and update `TWILIO_PHONE`

## Frontend Integration

The notification system works with the existing project creation form:
- Located at: `/Users/kavishka_r/Documents/ITP/SCWMS/PTFD/frontend/src/Components/Projects/AddProjects.js`
- Collects owner contact information (email and phone number)
- Submits data to backend which triggers notifications

## Error Handling

The system is designed to be fault-tolerant:
- If email configuration is invalid, only SMS will be sent (if configured)
- If SMS configuration is invalid, only email will be sent (if configured)
- If both configurations are invalid, project creation still succeeds
- Notification errors are logged but don't affect core functionality

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables are loaded server-side, never exposed to frontend
- Credentials are not stored in version control (add .env to .gitignore)
- All communication happens over HTTPS in production

## Future Enhancements

1. Add notification preferences for users
2. Implement notification templates for different project events (updates, completion, etc.)
3. Add notification delivery status tracking
4. Implement retry mechanism for failed notifications
5. Add support for other notification channels (push notifications, etc.)
